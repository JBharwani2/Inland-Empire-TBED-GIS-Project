# Inland Empire TBED-GIS
The `Inland Empire TBED-GIS` project was assigned to my team for the Software Project Management class at California Baptist University. This project was implemented alongside our partners at [NAVSEA Corona](https://www.navsea.navy.mil/Home/Warfare-Centers/NSWC-Corona/Who-We-Are/). They tasked us with developing an application to depict technology-based economic development (TBED) in the Inland Empire. Using open-source data and GIS tools, my team developed a high-level prototype that could be implemented by future students.

My role consisted of:
- Searching for open-source data that showed technology-based economic development for cities or counties in the inland empire
- Cleaning data for input into the GIS mapping softwares
- Testing various data visualization methods to maximize the readability of the data

The following are examples of maps created using my data in the geospatial analysis tool [Kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/):

This map uses data from [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) to find where CBU engineering graduates were employed upon graduation.
  
Each line represents a student who begins at CBU and ends at their location of employment.

This was used to study wether Inland Empire college graduates are finding employment locally or leaving the region to find work.

Data from the [California Employment Development Department](https://labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/data/county-to-county-commute-patterns.html).

The yellow arcs show the work commute flow of workers from neghboring counties who work in the Inland Empire. While the blue arcs show the work commute flow of workers from the Inland Empire who work in the neighoring Southern California counties.

This data allows users to visualize the number of Inland Empire residents who are commuting to neighboring counties for work.

Data from previous a NAVSEA team for all patents filed in the Inland Empire based on location and year.

Each vertical hex bin's height and color is dependent on the number of patents filed in that area.

Patents were separated by year from 2013 to 2020 to analyze changes over time.
